# Welcome to the W3Nest GitHub Group

## About Us

Our objective is to create a user-friendly, distributed cloud solution that operates locally on personal computers,
allowing users to access and install applications via a web browser. As users navigate through apps, necessary 
components are seamlessly downloaded to their devices, enabling a “tiny cloud” experience on each PC.
This ecosystem encourages collaboration and open-source contributions, allowing developers to add new components
easily and enhancing the development cycle by running everything locally.
The ultimate goal is to build a community-driven platform that empowers both developers and everyday users to
explore, create, and share applications in a decentralized, collaborative cloud environment.
